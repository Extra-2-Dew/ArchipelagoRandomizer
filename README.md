# Archipelago Randomizer For Ittle Dew 2

## What's an Archipelago Randomizer?

A randomizer is software that rearranges the items in a game, increasing replayability by ensuring you get items in a different order ever playthrough. In the case of Ittle Dew 2, your Raft Pieces could be hidden in some random caves, your dynamite could be locked behind a boss fight, and a yellow heart could be your reward for Northern End.

[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) is a multiworld framework, allowing multiple games to combine their randomizers and send items between players. For example, I could play Ittle Dew 2 while a friend plays Tunic. I find the Tunic player's stick, which allows them to defeat some enemies and find my dynamite. We continue exploring our islands whacking enemies with our sticks and blowing stuff up until we find enough items for us to both beat our games.

## What items are included in the randomizer?

Currently, the randomizer can give you the following:

* Everything in the Loot menu, except Forbidden Keys, Secret Shards, and the Big Ol' Bag of Loot
* All outfits
* All cards
* All standard dungeon keys

EFCS is replaced with the Impossible Gates Pass, which automatically opens doors that normally requires EFCS.

## What locations are included in the randomizer?

Currently, the following locations are randomized:

* All Optional Hidden Caves
* All chests and keys in the main eight dungeons
* All chests in the 15 main Portal Worlds (optional)
* Certain SUPER SECRET LOCATIONS (optional)

## What is the goal of the randomizere?

Currently, the only goal is Raft Quest, which requires that you obtain all eight Raft Pieces and return to Fluffy Fields to escape the island. Other goals will be added in the future.

## Getting Started

Starting a randomized playthrough requires two steps: setting up your yaml and connecting in-game.

### Setting up your YAML

The [release](https://github.com/Extra-2-Dew/ArchipelagoRandomizer/releases) includes a .yaml file, which is used for choosing your settings. You can open the YAML file with any text editor. Each setting has a description next to it, and is also described in the Options section of this readme. If you want to further customize your YAML and you're an advanced user, you may want to check out the [YAML](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en), [Triggers](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/triggers/en), and [Plando](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/plando/en) guides.

### Connecting to a multiworld

Once a server has been set up, launch Ittle Dew 2 and start a new game.

### Generating or Hosting?

If you want to generate a seed locally, or host a seed on either your own server or an official Archipelago server, read the [Setup guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en). You can get the apworld for Ittle Dew 2 with the [release](https://github.com/Extra-2-Dew/ArchipelagoRandomizer/releases).
